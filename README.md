# üé¨ Manim Animation Projects

A collection of mathematical and scientific visualizations created with [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), the mathematical animation engine. Exploring complex concepts through code and animation.

---

## üìÅ Projects in This Repository

### üåä The Three-Body Problem
`three_body_problem.py` 
> A numerical simulation and visualization of the famous chaotic gravitational system involving three stars. This animation demonstrates why their long-term motion is unpredictable and beautifully complex.

### üåÄ Fractal Zoom Animation
`fractal_zoom.py` 
> A deep dive into the Mandelbrot set, showcasing the infinite complexity and self-similarity of fractals. The animation zooms into the boundary, revealing intricate patterns that repeat forever.

### üß† AI: How it Works & The Future
`ai_explained.py`  
> An explainer video breaking down the fundamentals of neural networks and machine learning. It visualizes how data is transformed through layers and concludes with a thought-provoking look at the future potential and challenges of artificial intelligence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

*   [Manim Community Edition](https://www.manim.community/) - The animation engine for precise mathematical animations.
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used.
*   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Used for numerical computations (e.g., the Three-Body Problem).

## üöÄ How to Run These Animations

To render these animations locally, you need to have Manim installed.

1.  **Install Manim:**
    ```bash
    pip install manim
    ```
    *For a more detailed installation guide, especially with additional dependencies like LaTeX, see the [official documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).*

2.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[your-repo].git
    cd [this-repo]
    ```

3.  **Render an animation:**
    Navigate to the directory containing the Python files and run a command like:
    ```bash
    # Render a low-resolution preview to quickly check the animation
    manim -pql fractal_zoom.py FractalScene

    # Render a high-quality, 60fps video for final output
    manim -pqh --fps 60 ai_explained.py AIScene
    ```
